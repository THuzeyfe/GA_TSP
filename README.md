# GA_TSP
This is a genetic algorithm that has been designed to solve traveling salesman problem.
## Project Motivation
This project aims to show a implementation of a genetic algorithm for a traveling salesman problem. Implementation from scratch is good way to get similar with such algorithms. Genetic algorithm is very useful heuristics, that is still source of inspiration to many state of the art solvers. 
## Install
This project has been developed during a course by using class structure and *python3*. Thus, dependent class files does not belongs to me, and so these class files are not shared in this repository. However, I will list the dependent class files that I used, but this is not strict procedure, anyone can built her own class files. As long as the first construction and called functions works correctly, there will be no problem.
* **class City:** Store a city, with its coordinates.
* **class CityManager:** Used to set all cities.
* **class Route:** As its name, it holds a route for the traveling salesman.
* **class RouteManager:** Store all the population (all routes).
Rather than these class files, /*numpy*/ library is also imported in the genetic algorithm.
## File Descriptions
* **GeneticAlgorithmSolver.py:** Main file that stores genetic algorithm class. This class won't work without interacted classes decribed in previous section.
* **LICENCE*
* **README.md**
## Summary of Results and Explanations
A blog post is written to share analysis results. Available here: https://medium.com/@taha.huzeyfe/absolute-animal-heuristic-6675ef94ecc5
